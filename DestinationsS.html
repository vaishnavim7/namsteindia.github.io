					<h4>Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					One of the oldest living inhabitations of the world, the sacred city of Varanasi or Benaras, 
					nestled on the banks of the holy Ganges river, has been attracting pilgrims for centuries. 
					Celebrated author Mark Twain, who visited India in the last decade of the 19th century, 
					described the city as “older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend.”
					
					Believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva, Varanasi is among the seven sacred cities in the 
					country. Centuries of history, art and tradition have conflated to add colourful layers to 
					Varanasi's aura, which is most spectacularly evident at its ghats (stepped banks of a river). 
					An abode of travellers in search of holiness and divine providence, the ghats of the Ganges 
					are the highlight of the spiritual scene of Varanasi. From the famous Ganga arti 
					(a fire ritual) to cremation ceremonies, the ghats are the site of time-honoured rituals that 
					are performed to this day.
					
					Varanasi is also one of the holiest sites of Buddhism, as it was in Sarnath, which is located 
					merely 12 km away, that Lord Buddha preached his first sermon. Jain literature, too, refers to 
					Kashi as a holy city, as it is the birthplace of four Jain tirthankaras (saints).

					<h4>Haridwar, Uttarakhand</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Bustling with devotees, its air filled with the sweet smell of incense sticks and clanging of 
					temple bells, the city of Haridwar at the foothills of the Himalayas, is one of Hinduism’s 
					holiest destinations.It sees thousands of people taking a dip in the holy waters of River 
					Ganges, which emerges from the Himalayas here. Devotees, sadhus (saffron-clad men) and saints 
					throng the river’s ghats (stepped banks), to take a dip in its sacred waters and, according to 
					Hindu beliefs, wash away their sins. The most famous ghat, the bustling and colourful Har ki 
					Pauri, sees a large number of bathers throughout the year, but more during festivals.

					Every morning and evening, the ghat witnesses the blissful Ganga arti (a fire ritual), 
					which also attracts devotees and tourists. The evening ritual being more popular, 
					it makes for a mesmeric sight to see the river being venerated with loud and rhythmic chants 
					and tall lamps, their lights lightening up the darkening waters. Soak in the spiritual fervour 
					of the city, as you watch the spectacular sight of thousands of small diyas (earthen lamps) 
					floating on the river.

					<h4>Rishikesh, Uttarakhand</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Nestled in the Himalayan foothills, Rishikesh is one of the most sacred cities in northern 
					India. Located in the state of Uttarakhand, Rishikesh is the hub of sages, yoga practitioners 
					and pilgrims, who throng the ghats (stepped banks of a river) and temples. In recent times, 
					it has also become a centre point of adventure sports, offering activities like white water 
					rafting, bungee jumping, canoeing and others. Ever since the Beatles arrived at Maharishi 
					Mahesh Yogi’s ashram here in the 1960s, looking for peace and inspiration for their music, 
					Rishikesh has been a favourite destination for soul-seeking. Often called the yoga capital of 
					the world, the tranquil forested slopes on the city’s outskirts are dotted with ashrams 
					(places of spirituality and meditation), yoga institutes and luxurious spa resorts. 
					The city sees a flurry of activity during February-March, as it plays host to dignitaries and 
					yoga enthusiasts who come to take part in the International Yoga Week, organised by the State 
					Tourism Department. Rishikesh is also noted for Ayurveda, and is home to several institutes 
					offering education in the same. It is also known for its yoga schools, some of which are

					<h4>Amritsar, Punjab</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					A bustling city with an indomitable spirit, Amritsar holds one of the holiest of Sikh ethos at 
					its heart - the Golden Temple. Covered in 400 kg of gold and surrounded by a serene sarovar 
					(pond), one is immediately swamped by the humbling sight of the glistening structure, 
					which is also home to one of the biggest community kitchens (langar) in the country that 
					serves about 20,000 people a day.

					Though visitors often make a beeline for the temple, the old-world charm of the city slowly 
					sneaks up on them, making them fall in love with a city that buzzes with spirited and lively 
					nuances. Be it the bullet-ridden walls of Jallianwala Bagh or the energetically charged scene 
					of the Wagah Border, one has to step into the city to feel the passion of thousands of people 
					who laid down their lives for the country. The many Indo-British style buildings that dot the 
					city's landscape stand as a testimony to its rich history and significant contribution to the 
					Indian freedom movement. Amritsar gets its name from the holy tank called Amrit Sarovar, 
					meaning pool of nectar, which surrounds the Golden Temple.

					<h4>Bodhgaya, Bihar</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					The quaint town of Bodh Gaya, in Bihar, echoes with a tranquil ambience, underlined by intense 
					devotion. Dotted with temples and monasteries, this 2,500-year-old birthplace of Buddhism 
					invites travellers from all across the world to soak in its spiritual vibes, retrace the 
					footsteps of Lord Buddha and understand his philosophies at the place where he attained 
					nirvana (enlightenment). The city ebbs and flows with devotees throughout the year, 
					yet it remains suspended in time, as monks in saffron and maroon robes walk around the 
					monuments and temples, their chants and prayers enveloping the surroundings in a cocoon of 
					peace. Even the air of this small town seems to be permeated with peace and serenity, 
					synonymous with Buddhism. Prince Siddhartha, who later became Lord Buddha, is said to have 
					found a quiet retreat under the most hallowed spot here, the Bo or Bodhi tree, where he 
					meditated till the attainment of enlightenment. Gaya is mentioned in the great epics like 
					the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.

					who come here to pay obeisance at the Lord Jagannath Temple, Puri is also known worldwide for

					city gets busy celebrating the annual festival of Ratha Yatra (chariot procession of Lord 
					Jagannath), that sees lakhs of footfalls, the other part on the outskirts, fringed by beaches 
					and lakes, remains blanketed in relative calm and serenity, making it a hub for nature lovers.

					<h4>Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Among the holiest towns of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvannamalai is a popular pilgrim site, which is 
					believed to one of the five spots in South India, where elements of nature (fire, air, water, 
					earth, ether) are worshipped. In this mountain-temple town, situated at the foothills of 
					Mt Arunachala, Lord Shiva is worshipped in his fire avatar (Arunachaleswara). 
					The town is sprawled around the iconic Arunachaleswarar Temple, a spectacular structure 
					boasting four huge gateways or gopurams. On full moon nights, the town sees a sea of devotees 
					arriving to perform the 14-km walk of Girivalam, around the Annamalai hill. It is a mesmeric 
					sight to see barefoot devotees gazing at the temple atop the hill and walking while chanting 
					“Om Arunachala”.

					Tiruvannamalai hosts a smattering of serene ashrams that are spiritual retreats for visitors. 
					A popular picnic spot among locals and tourists is the Sathanur Dam over River Thenpennai, 
					around 20 km from the city.
					
					Tiruvannamalai has a rich architectural legacy as it was ruled by Pallavas, Cholas, Hoysalas, 
					kings of the Vijayanagar empire, the Carnatic kingdom, Tipu Sultan and the British.

					<h4>Shirdi, Maharashtra</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					One of the most famous pilgrim centres of India, Shirdi is where Sai Baba, the saint known for 
					his divine powers, lived and preached for over five decades. Samadhi Temple, where he lived, 
					has a room that depicts articles and things used by Shri Sai during his lifetime, and is 
					therefore quite significant for his disciples, who follow his teachings and rever him till 
					date. The temple also houses his mortal remains.

					Every day, over 60,000 tourists and devotees from all faiths and religions throng to the 
					temple, and this number increases during festive seasons. The temple opens at 4:00 am and 
					one has to wait in a queue to get a glimpse of the idol and worship him. Other places related 
					to the life of Shri Sai in Shirdi include Dwarkamayi Masjid, Chavadi and Gurusthan.
					
					Dwarkamayi Masjid, which is a mosque with a temple inside, may be the only one of its kind in 
					India. Another interesting aspect of the mosque is that the dhuni, or holy fire that Sai Baba 
					allegedly lit here has been kept burning to this day. The ash that falls from the dhuni is 
					considered to have healing powers.

					<h4>Somnath Temple, Gujarat</h4>
					<br><hr><br>

					Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Somnath Temple is one of the most important spiritual sites in 
					the Hindu circuit. Believed to be the first of the 12 jyotirlingas (devotional shrines of Lord 
					Shiva) in the country, the temple sees a large footfall every year. Skirted by the Arabian Sea,

					(hall) and the main shrine, whose arches tower over the whole temple complex. After paying 
					obeisance, devotees can slip through a side door to find an ethereal view of sunlight tripping 
					over the sea waves.
					
					Located about 94 km from Junagadh, the Somnath Temple is said to have been originally built by 
					the moon god with gold. Later, it was razed to the ground and rebuilt by Ravana with silver. 
					Later, Lord Krishna made it in wood and then an edifice of stone was erected by one of the 
					Pandava brothers, Bhima.

					Goddess Lakshmi, and the one on the left is black representing Goddess Kali. 
					The holy cave shrine is said to have been built by the Pandavas of the epic Mahabharata.
